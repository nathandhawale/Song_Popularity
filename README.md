This is a quick presentation of my dataset. I am working on a project that is focusing on the popularity of songs based on different metrics. I got this dataset from kaggle and has over 15000 songs pulled from Spotify. So far, I have cleaned the data and made several visualizations and also looked at correlations between different metrics and getting ready to start doing regression analysis on the data.
The linear regression and RandomForest Regression models worked best to predict the popularity of a song

I ran several different models on this data to predict the song popularity and I discovered that a random forest regression model aling with gradient boosting regressor works well with the training and testing set.
